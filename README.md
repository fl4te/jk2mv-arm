# Howto Build JK2MV
1. Clone the JK2MV repository
Clone the JK2MV repository including submodules (required if you also want to build the [mvsdk](https://github.com/mvdevs/mvsdk) modules), e.g.:
	* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mvdevs/jk2mv`
2. Get CMake from either https://cmake.org or, in case of Linux, from the repositories of your distribution.
3. Dependencies
 	* Windows: Requires at least Visual Studio 2013, required libraries are shipped with JK2MV in the `libs` directory.
		* If you plan to build the installer package get NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net
	* Linux/FreeBSD: OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL2 and depending on your configuration libjpeg, libpng, libminizip, zlib.
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install git debhelper devscripts libsdl2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libminizip-dev`
		* Fedora: `dnf install git SDL2-devel mesa-libGL-devel openal-soft-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel minizip-devel`
	* MacOSX: XCode on MacOSX >= 10.9
		* Configure / Build SDL2:
			1. `curl -O https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz`
			2. `tar xzf SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz && cd SDL2-2.0.10/Xcode/SDL`
			4. `sed -i -e 's/@rpath//g' SDL.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (packaging fails otherwise)
			5. `xcodebuild -configuration Release`
			6. `mkdir -p ~/Library/Frameworks/`
			7. ``ln -s `pwd`/build/Release/SDL2.framework ~/Library/Frameworks``
4. Configuration
	* Either
		* Use the CMake GUI to configure JK2MV
		* Generate the default configuration by using the build scripts in the `build` directory.
	* Important Options
		* `BuildPortableVersion` Build portable version (does not read or write files from your user/home directory)
		* `BuildMVMP` Whether to create targets for the client (jk2mvmp & jk2mvmenu)
		* `BuildMVDED` Whether to create targets for the dedicated server (jk2mvded)
		* `BuildMVSDK` Whether to build and integrate the mvsdk modules.
		* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug/Release` Build for development/release.
5. Building
	* Unix-Makefiles
		* `make` Build all previously selected binaries.
		* `make install` Installs JK2MV to `/usr` on Linux. On MacOSX it finishes the App-Package.
		* `make package` Generates rpm/deb packages on Linux and a dmg image on MacOSX.
